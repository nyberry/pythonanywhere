# The Dinner Party Game
### A guessing game for 4-10 players
## How it works
- Once you join the game, you are asked a question.
- When all players have given an answer, the game begins.
- All the answers are displayed, anonymously.
- Taking it in turns, the players have to guess which player gave each answer.
- Once a player and their answer have been correctly guessed, that player is "out".
- When only one player remains, they are the winner.
